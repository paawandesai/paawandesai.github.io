Hi, I'm Paawan! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu), specializing in Software Engineering and Design, with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I am also a proud recipient of the [Bostick Francis Scholarship for Electrical Engineers](https://www.statesman.com/obituaries/p0157680).

With a robust foundation in programming, data analysis, and software design, my passion thrives at the intersection of technology and innovation. I have spearheaded impactful projects, such as developing sophisticated machine learning models for handwriting recognition and designing advanced geospatial tools for sustainable urban planning. Currently, my senior design project involves building a Verilog-based accelerator for post-quantum cryptography, highlighting my commitment to cutting-edge solutions.

Beyond academics, I co-founded and serve as an engineer at Fundare Finance. In this role, I lead the development of a SaaS product aimed at streamlining revenue growth tracking for small businesses. My diverse experiences also encompass tutoring advanced mathematics, creating educational platforms, and contributing to community service initiatives.

Collaboration and leadership are cornerstones of my endeavors. I lead a nationally competitive Bollywood fusion dance team, where I skillfully balance creativity with technical expertise. 

When I'm not immersed in coding or project management, youâ€™ll find me exploring entrepreneurial ventures, mentoring students, or diving into new technological and design challenges. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/paawan-desai) or [GitHub](https://github.com/paawandesai).
