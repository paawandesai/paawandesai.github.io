Hi, I'm Paawan! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu), specializing in Software Engineering and Design, with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I am also a proud recipient of the prestigious **Bostick Francis Scholarship for Electrical Engineers**.

With a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and software design, my passion lies at the intersection of technology and innovation. I have led impactful projects, from developing machine learning models for handwriting recognition to designing geospatial tools for sustainable urban planning. My ongoing senior design project focuses on building a Verilog-based accelerator for post-quantum cryptography, reflecting my interest in cutting-edge technologies.

In addition to academics, I co-founded **Fundare Finance**, where I am leading the development of a SaaS product to streamline revenue growth tracking for small businesses. My experiences have also allowed me to tutor advanced mathematics, create educational platforms, and contribute to community service initiatives.

Beyond engineering, I thrive on collaboration and leadership. I am leading a nationally competitive Bollywood fusion dance team, showcasing my ability to balance creativity with technical expertise.

When I’m not coding or managing projects, you’ll find me exploring entrepreneurial ventures, mentoring students, or diving into new challenges in technology and design. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/paawan-desai) or [GitHub](https://github.com/paawandesai).
