Hi, I'm Paawan! I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu), where I specialized in Software Engineering and Design and completed a minor in Entrepreneurship. I am also a proud recipient of the [Bostick Francis Scholarship for Electrical Engineers](https://www.statesman.com/obituaries/p0157680).

I now work as an AI & Data Analyst at SkyTerra Group, an AI, ML, and engineering-focused consulting group in the energy space. My work bridges biometric AI systems and renewable energy microgrids: from engineering edge-to-cloud pipelines for healthcare wearables, to directing field integration of off-grid hybrid power systems. This role lets me bring together my passions for machine learning, embedded systems, and sustainable technology to solve high-impact, real-world problems.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve built and led projects spanning biometric signal analysis, cryptographic accelerators, geospatial analytics, financial modeling, and energy systems design. My work has been recognized through hackathon wins, senior design leadership, and client-facing consulting projects.

Beyond engineering, I co-founded Fundare Finance, where I developed a SaaS dashboard for small-business revenue tracking, and I’ve contributed to education as a mathematics tutor and teacher. I also led and performed with a nationally competitive Bollywood fusion dance team, balancing creativity, collaboration, and leadership.

When I’m not immersed in data pipelines, ML models, or microgrid systems, you’ll find me exploring entrepreneurial ventures, mentoring students, or diving into new design and technology challenges. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/paawan-desai) or [GitHub](https://github.com/paawandesai).
