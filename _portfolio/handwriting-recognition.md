### Overview
Developed a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to recognize handwritten text from a dataset of 400,000+ samples. The project integrates attention mechanisms and advanced preprocessing techniques to handle noisy and overlapping handwriting.

### Key Features
- **85% Character Accuracy:** Achieved high recognition accuracy through model optimization.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Enhanced focus on relevant parts of handwriting input.
- **Preprocessing:** Implemented normalization and cropping for improved performance.

### Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV  
- **Dataset Management:** Kaggle
