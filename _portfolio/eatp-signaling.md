### Overview
As part of the Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science under [Dr. Gregory Clark](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/roux/gregclark), this research explored extracellular ATP-induced stomatal closure using Arabidopsis thaliana. The study provided critical insights into plant cellular signaling pathways.

### Key Contributions
- Analyzed the role of pgp4-1 knockout in extracellular ATP signaling.
- Utilized ImageJ and RStudio for precise data analysis and statistical validation.
- Advanced the scientific understanding of cellular signaling in plant biology.

### Tools Used
- **Software:** ImageJ, RStudio
