### Overview
As part of the Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science under [Dr. Gregory Clark](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/roux/gregclark), this research investigated the role of pgp4-1 in extracellular ATP-induced stomatal closure using Arabidopsis thaliana. The project focused on advancing the understanding of plant cell signaling pathways through rigorous experimentation and data analysis.

### Key Contributions
- Studied the impact of pgp4-1 knockout on extracellular ATP signaling pathways.  
- Processed and analyzed data with ImageJ for image analysis and RStudio for statistical validation.  
- Expanded understanding of cellular signaling mechanisms through precise experimental design and execution.

### Tools Used
- **Software:** ImageJ, RStudio
