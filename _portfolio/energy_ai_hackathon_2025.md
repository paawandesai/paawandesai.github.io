### Overview
As part of the Energy A.I. Hackathon 2025, our team developed a machine learning pipeline to predict energy consumption (**Grid, Diesel, and CNG**) for hydraulic fracturing operations. The project integrated robust uncertainty modeling, advanced feature engineering, and domain-specific insights, earning **1st Place** out of 15 teams.  

### Key Features
- **High Prediction Accuracy:** Achieved **R²** scores of 0.9918 (Grid), 0.9766 (Diesel), and 0.9692 (CNG) using **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** models.  
- **Uncertainty Modeling:** Quantified prediction uncertainty with 100 realizations per well.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Leveraged **CatBoost encoding**, feature ranking, and temporal modeling to enhance predictions.  
- **Custom Libraries:** Integrated **ozbayrak_goodness** for model evaluation and **UTuning** for hyperparameter optimization.

### Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, CatBoost  
- **Custom Libraries:** ozbayrak_goodness, UTuning  

### Achievements
- **First Place Winners:** Secured top position among 25 teams in accuracy (MAPE), code quality, and presentation.
