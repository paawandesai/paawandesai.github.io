### Overview
Constructed time-series forecasting models using advanced statistical techniques to analyze NASDAQ, S&P 500, and CFTC market data. This project focuses on identifying cross-market correlations, predicting market dynamics, and deriving actionable financial insights.

### Key Features
- **Bayesian Modeling:** Applied kernel-based regression to identify trends and correlations.  
- **Volatility Prediction:** Leveraged Prophet for robust market forecasting.  
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzed historical market trends across major indices for actionable insights.  
- **Technical Indicators:** Integrated Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD for enhanced trend analysis.  

### Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Orbit, Prophet, Plotly, Pandas, NumPy  

### Current Progress
- **Data Integration:** Successfully merged datasets from NASDAQ, S&P 500, and CFTC data sources. All files are aligned by date and cleaned for consistency.
- **Technical Analysis Implementation:** 
  - Calculated key indicators like Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD for NASDAQ stocks.
  - Visualized trends using dynamic and interactive charts to identify potential breakout signals.
- **CFTC Correlation Study:** Conducted initial analysis of trader positioning and its correlation with S&P 500 index movements.
- **Error Handling & Debugging:** Enhanced robustness by handling missing or inconsistent data files. Added checks for sufficient data length for rolling calculations.

### Next Steps
- **Forecasting Models:** Develop and validate time-series forecasting models using Prophet and Orbit.
- **Cross-Market Analysis:** Explore deeper correlations between CFTC trader data and market movements to predict macroeconomic impacts.
- **Actionable Insights:** Automate the generation of buy/sell/hold signals based on combined technical indicators.
- **Scalability:** Implement scheduling for regular updates of data and automated analysis pipelines.
