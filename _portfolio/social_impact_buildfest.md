### Overview
As part of the **Social Impact BuildFest**, I developed a Python GUI that enhances digital advocacy using **sentiment analysis and text-to-speech** to drive haptic feedback on **DataFeel devices**. The tool analyzes text **sentence-by-sentence**, classifying emotional intensity using **rule-based (NLTK, MWEs) and transformer-based (Hugging Face) models**.  

This project focuses on **accessibility** by incorporating **dyslexia-friendly fonts, UI contrast adjustments, and customizable text settings**, ensuring a more inclusive advocacy experience.

### Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** Combines **rule-based NLP (NLTK lexicons, MWEs)** and **transformer-based models (Hugging Face)** to classify emotional intensity.  
- **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Converts emotion-based text classification into **DataFeel haptic commands**.  
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Supports **dyslexia-friendly fonts (OpenDyslexic, Atkinson Hyperlegible), adjustable contrast, and font size options**.  
- **Automation & Visualization:** Enables **batch processing** of text files and provides **emotion timeline visualization** using **matplotlib**.  

### Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** PyQt6, NLTK, Hugging Face, Matplotlib, Pyttsx3  
- **Hardware Integration:** DataFeel SDK  

### Impact
- Improved **digital advocacy accessibility**, enabling a **multi-sensory experience** for individuals with visual impairments or learning disabilities.  
- Created a **user-friendly, customizable interface** to enhance text-based emotional engagement.
