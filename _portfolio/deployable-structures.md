### Overview
This research project, conducted at the **Human Centered Robotics Laboratory** at UT Austin, focused on designing and testing deployable structural prototypes to enhance seismic resistance. The project aimed to transform a truss-frame system into a vertical-link eccentrically braced frame for improved performance under earthquake-induced forces.

### Key Contributions
- Designed a deployable structural prototype using advanced engineering tools.
- Simulated structural behavior under seismic and gravitational loads with MATLAB.
- Validated deployment mechanisms using LabVIEW for real-world applications.

### Tools Used
- **Software:** MATLAB, LabVIEW, SolidWorks
