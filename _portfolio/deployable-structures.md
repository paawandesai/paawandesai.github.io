### Overview
This research, conducted at the [Human Centered Robotics Laboratory](https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/) at UT Austin, focused on creating deployable structural prototypes to enhance seismic resilience. The project transformed a truss-frame system into a vertical-link eccentrically braced frame, optimizing performance under seismic loads.

### Key Contributions
- Simulated structural dynamics under combined seismic and gravitational forces using MATLAB.
- Validated real-world applicability of deployment mechanisms via LabVIEW.

### Tools Used
- **Software:** MATLAB, LabVIEW, SolidWorks
